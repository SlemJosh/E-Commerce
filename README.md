# Ecommerce Back End

## Description

This project was about taking some existing code and making a fully functional backend for an ecommerce site. While we were given the information contained in the database, we had to write routes and methods for which those table values would relate to each other as well as be able to be manipulated. The biggest challenge with this project, was that because it was all backend, there was a lot of back and forth of starting and stopping the servers each time a change needed to be made. Finally we were able to get it functioning well and we use Insomnia to have a better viewing experience of the backend processes.

To use the project, you will first need to start up and source the SQL db/schema. Once that is done, you can type in npm run seed to populate the database. Lastly just need to do a npm start, to get the server up and running. From there it's all backend stuff that we use Insomnia to get a better visualization of our work.
